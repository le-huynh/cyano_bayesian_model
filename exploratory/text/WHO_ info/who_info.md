# CyanoHAB ALERT LEVEL

__threshold__: cyanobacterial biomass level, assuming the species is a potential producer of MCs, where raw water MCs concentration could exceed (WHO) guideline.
__WHO guideline__: drinking water: MC-LR <= 1µg/L (free plus cell-bound)

## WHO 
summary Fig 6.5 (@Bartram1999a)
### Drinking water (@Bartram1999a)
- __Vigilance level__: 
+ possible early stages of bloom development --> cyanobacteria first detected in unconcentrated raw water samples.
+ cyanobacteria detected at low leves --> 1 colony or >= 5 filaments per mL --> `200 cells/mL` or 0.1 µg/L Chl-a
- __Alert level 1__:
+ require assessment to be made --> toxin concentration/ bloom status/ water treatment
+ cyanobacteria biomass `>= 2000 cells/mL`
+ >= 0.2 mm3/L biovolume
+ >= 1 µg/L Chl-a
- __Alert level 2__:
+ significant increase in the risk of adverse human health --> require water treatment + public media warning.
+ cyanobacteria biomass `> 100,000` cells/mL
+ > 10 mm3/L biovolume
+ > 50 µg/L Chl-a
+ toxin confirmed by chemical/bioassay techniques
### Bathing waters
_ Table 8.3_ @WHO2013
- __Relative low__ probability of adverse health effects:
+ 20,000 cells/mL
+ 10 µg/L Chl-a with dominance of cyanobacteria
- __Moderate__ probability:
+ 100,000 cells/mL
+ 50 µg/L Chl-a
